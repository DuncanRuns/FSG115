# 115 FSG
 FSG Filter for Minecraft 1.15.2 written with a fork of KaptainWutax's seed finding libraries.

## Usage

To generate a seed, you can run the jar through a .bat file that pauses after execution to let you copy the seed. This .bat file will be included in the release.

I recommend using a macro to generate and play seeds, such as [my 1.15 fsg macro](https://github.com/DuncanRuns/FSG115-Macro/releases).
