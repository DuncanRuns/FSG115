# 115 FSG
 FSG Filter for Minecraft 1.15.2 written with a fork of KaptainWutax's seed finding libraries.

## Usage

In its current state, the generator is very basic and offers no security. This should be seen as a practice seed generator for now.

To generate a seed, you can run the jar through a .bat file that pauses after execution to let you copy the seed. This .bat file will be included in the release.
